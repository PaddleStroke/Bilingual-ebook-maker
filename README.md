# Bilingual-ebook-maker
I created this script in order to create automatically bilingual ebooks from two ebooks in different languages.
Bilingual ebook with one paragraph in one language, then the other in another language. Those kind of books are great to learn a foreign language.

This task which seems easy is not so because different translations of the same book usually don't have exactly the same paragraphs

The main principle is that books can be considered as binary strings if you say that dialogs are 1 and paragraphs are 0.
The script try to match the 2 binary strings as well as possible. It's not perfect but you can improve it maybe.
